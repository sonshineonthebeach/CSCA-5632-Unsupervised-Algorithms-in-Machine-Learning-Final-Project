CSCA 5632 Unsupervised Learning Final Project
Problem to Solve
This project uses K-Clusering and PCA methods to analyze set of data about healthy lifestyle cities from 2021 to determine which cities are the best and the worst in term of City,Rank,Sunshine hours(City),Cost of a bottle of water(City),Obesity levels(Country),Life expectancy(years) (Country),Pollution(Index score) (City),Annual avg. hours worked,Happiness levels(Country),Outdoor activities(City),Number of take out places(City),Cost of a monthly gym membership(City). Please note that this project targets audience who care about these factors. The analyzing results from this project do NOT indicate if the cities are good or bad because it uses its own set of factors that affect the analyzing results.

Data Source
The data was downloaded from the internet.

Unsupervised Learning Methods Used
PCA method is used to reduce dimenalities of large datasets. The PCA method helps us reduce dimentionality of large dataset. It also helps us improve performance and understand data more. K-Clustering method is used to group up cities which have the similar factors.
